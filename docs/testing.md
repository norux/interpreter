# Testing Jamak

## Default checks

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run verify
```

`verify` runs Biome, application and platform-independent type checks, the Chrome build, unit/fixture tests and the controlled-clock caption browser check. It does not establish real model accuracy or native Chrome feature availability. Build output is `apps/chrome/dist`.

`npm test` runs `test:js` and `test:captions-stability`. Package scripts retain the release, speaker and live conversation checks listed below, plus `test:conversation` to serve the manual fixture. The former `test:framework:*` aliases and their aggregate runner are removed; individual unit and browser harnesses remain available. For a focused check, run `node --import tsx --test tests/<name>.test.ts` or `node --test tests/<name>.test.mjs`; run browser harnesses directly with `node tests/<name>.mjs` and their existing flags, for example `node tests/framework-chrome-tab-engine.mjs --capture-loss`. Use `node --import tsx tests/framework-chrome-replay.mjs` for the replay harness. Run type checks separately when needed. Dated reports under `docs/verification/` preserve the commands used at the time.

`npm run test:release:chrome` checks the release CLI with a stubbed verification command and mocked API responses, including real ZIP creation and submission stopping on failures. It is also included in `verify`. `npm run release:chrome -- --dry-run` runs the actual verification/build pipeline and creates a release ZIP without authentication, upload or submission. See [Releasing](releasing.md) for setup and the limits of these checks.

`node tests/framework-chrome-popup.mjs` verifies popup progress display with mocked background snapshots: reported percentages, indeterminate loading, reopening during preparation and hiding after readiness, plus automatic/manual model-information rows, manual defaults, Japanese native speech preference even on WebGPU, restoring automatic mode, selecting a language disabling detection, and Korean skipping translation probes and SODA installation. It also checks the separate Advanced window, original tab/source forwarding, both selectors, preparation immediately on selection, persistence on reopen, Stop and reset to both Chrome defaults. It does not verify download speed or native model accuracy.

## Model selection checks

`npm run verify` includes all recognition/translation option combinations with mocked worker preparation, native preference/explicit override, selected WASM/WebGPU backend, Korean bypass, disposal and stale-result cancellation. It validates settings and cache identities; these are routing checks, not real model quality.

`node --import tsx --test tests/framework-chrome-advanced-download.test.ts tests/framework-chrome-preparation-notification.test.ts tests/framework-chrome-model-switch.test.ts` checks Advanced missing/partial/truncated/complete/evicted caches, cache reuse on reopening, download versus loaded readiness, and completion notification routing independent of an Advanced listener. Cache headers, native APIs, inference workers and the notification API are mocked; these checks do not prove acoustic accuracy or visible OS notification delivery. `node tests/framework-chrome-popup.mjs` also verifies Chrome pack labels, Advanced progress, and selected Tiny/M2M100 model information replacing old SODA metadata without accepting old readiness.

- `node tests/framework-chrome-model-translation.mjs`: downloads both pinned alternative translation models, executes real WASM English/Japanese → Korean translations on synthetic text, checks source revision pairing, Stop and cache-only reload. Uses an owned regular browser profile; incognito Cache Storage can fail on large files. First downloads total ~1.55 GB.
- `node tests/framework-chrome-model-options.mjs`: actual unpacked extension action → separate Advanced → Tiny q8 / M2M100 q8 → real model downloads → tab capture of the checked-in synthetic English clip → Korean page overlay, persisted selectors, popup model information, switching to Base during a running session while retaining M2M100, a fresh caption session and Stop. Uses an owned Chrome profile and actual action authorization. It does not establish conversational accuracy for every Whisper variant or a latency bound.

Both scripts write ignored evidence under `.ralph/media-framework/`. See [model selection evidence](verification/model-options.md). Existing real acoustic checks continue to verify Chrome defaults; use the explicit selections when comparing models, and report their names/backends with measurements.

## Automatic language checks

`npm run verify` includes mocked regression checks for alternating languages, uncertain-language PCM retention, exact revision pairing, prepared translator reuse, Korean bypass, per-turn boundaries and Stop cancellation. These are behavioral checks, not acoustic accuracy measurements.

`npm run test:auto-language:live` exercises the production popup → offscreen tab capture → real Whisper large-v3-turbo FP16/WebGPU → native TranslateKit → page overlay on `tests/fixtures/multilingual/meeting.wav`. It requires the same official Chrome translation components described below and WebGPU. It checks all six alternating English/Japanese/Korean turns, first words and sentence-content anchors, final source-specific translation pairing after provisional captions drain, Korean bypass, visible captions, Stop and navigation. It downloads the pinned model when uncached; an optional `INTERPRETER_TEST_MODEL_DIRECTORY` can seed the same two SHA-256-verified official ONNX files using the harness's existing test-only provisioning. Do not commit those files.

The checked-in fixture uses Samantha/Kyoko/Yuna synthetic voices; `python3 tests/fixtures/multilingual/generate.py` reproduces it on macOS with those voices installed. Run `npm run test:conversation` for the existing English fixture; to serve the multilingual audio manually, run `python3 -m http.server 8790 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory tests/fixtures/multilingual`, then open `/meeting.wav` and select automatic mode in Jamak. This verifies tab audio, not microphone capture or simultaneous voice separation. See [measured evidence](verification/asr/automatic-language.md).

## Caption and speaker checks

`node --import tsx --test tests/framework-browser-streaming.test.ts tests/framework-browser-translation.test.ts` checks Whisper text appearing before sentence completion, same-ID corrections/finalization, queued draft coalescing, automatic-language correction with onset PCM retained, obsolete draft translation rejection through the actual pipeline, and existing sentence/tail/prefix/Stop invariants. Recognition and translation outputs are mocked; these checks do not establish acoustic accuracy or display latency.

These checks also cover withdrawal of a removed Whisper tail, an empty completed speech-boundary result, and a final filler-only correction while translation is in flight. `node --import tsx --test tests/framework-core.test.ts tests/framework-presentation.test.ts tests/framework-chrome-overlay.test.ts` verifies withdrawal validation, history removal, late-result rejection and release of later completed rows without restarting their reading clocks. `npm run test:captions-stability` checks the orphan's removal and subsequent stack drain in an actual browser DOM with synthetic captions and a controlled clock.

| Command | Verifies |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test:captions-stability` | Ready captions appear immediately below earlier captions; provisional rows stay and accept late corrections in the same DOM row until final; pending corrections hold even old final pairs; visible reading clocks overlap; a narrow-screen burst of 12 rows remains bounded and all rows display before retiring oldest first; speaker colors, 4-second final holds and 250 ms fades remain correct |
| `npm run test:speakers` | Actual local WeSpeaker embeddings on the synthetic two-voice conversation; downloads model files when uncached |
| `npm run test:conversation` | Serves two-voice conversations at `http://127.0.0.1:8790`: English (~58 s) or Japanese (~76 s, `?language=ja`) |
| `npm run test:conversation:live` | Production popup → offscreen tab audio → Chrome local recognition/translation → page overlay; final pairing, sentence order, speaker consistency, completion/fade and Stop |
| `npm run test:conversation:ja:live` | Production Japanese Chrome local streaming → TranslateKit → overlay; native interim results without Whisper jobs, first source/Korean display timings, CER ≤12%, eight turns' source/Korean content, two speakers, ordered display without replay, completion/fade and Stop; lexical relationship errors are reported separately in `missingKoreanDetails`; local report `.ralph/caption-conversation/live-ja.json` |
| `node tests/framework-chrome-overlay.mjs` | Real extension transport and browser Fullscreen API: selected video/player, shipping whole-tab video and cross-origin embedded video; stacked captions/corrections, visible geometry, pointer passthrough, inline restoration and top-layer cleanup on Stop; caption inputs are synthetic |
| `node tests/framework-chrome-tab-input.mjs` | Real action-authorized capture/playback and target lifecycle |

Native recognition/translation checks require compatible desktop Chrome, installed local speech/translation packs, a graphical session, and the official Chrome translation components expected by the harness at `.ralph/media-framework/chrome-translation-components`. They are explicit local checks, not CI prerequisites. Some media fixture regeneration uses macOS `say`/`afconvert`; checked-in synthetic fixtures are available without regeneration.

`node tests/framework-chrome-translation.mjs` checks real TranslateKit on synthetic text, including unpunctuated polite questions followed by an explanation and requests ending in よ followed by an arrival statement. It checks Korean follow-up content as well as exact final pairing, so a successfully returned first-clause-only translation fails. `tests/framework-browser-translation.test.ts` mocks native output to verify that every phrase is submitted and joined without splitting quoted questions or spaced time expressions. This text check does not establish recognition accuracy on the original video.

The default Japanese conversation check requires Chrome's on-device speech API and Japanese/English/Korean SODA packs, following the same native streaming path as English. To check the Whisper fallback explicitly, run `node tests/framework-chrome-tab-engine.mjs --japanese-conversation --whisper` on WebGPU. To reuse already downloaded official Whisper weights, set `INTERPRETER_TEST_MODEL_DIRECTORY` to a directory containing `interpreter-turbo-encoder-verified.onnx` and `interpreter-turbo-decoder.onnx`; the harness verifies their registered sizes and SHA-256 values before seeding only its disposable extension cache. Other artifacts still use official downloads. A passed content/flow gate does not establish exact Japanese word recognition or perfect translation of kinship, politeness or implied subjects.

The conversation report records media playback state/events and each ASR job's PCM RMS/peak. If text repeats after playback ends, compare playback restarts, job audio ranges and input energy before attributing the repeat to recognition or caption timers. These diagnostics do not change production audio processing.

Conversation reports also capture emitted source revisions and count captions displayed before the first final revision of the same ID. The `--whisper` conversation check requires provisional recognition and at least one such visible draft in addition to final source/Korean meaning and display completion. First-display latency describes an initial provisional caption, not a complete or final sentence.

For a caption bug, first reproduce it with a failing focused check. For audio or model behavior, inspect the actual conversation and run the corresponding real model/browser check. Report synthetic display tests separately from native inference. Do not call a test passed because preparation, mocked text or PCM acquisition succeeded.

`node --import tsx --test tests/framework-presentation.test.ts` checks that newer rows cannot expire provisional source-only or paired text, a final source waits for a final translation, pending corrections block an old final pair's expiry, unchanged corrected finals receive four seconds of reading time, and completed rows still retire in insertion order. The controlled-clock browser check above verifies actual row retention and late DOM updates with synthetic caption inputs; neither check measures recognition or translation accuracy.

Temporary artifacts, model caches and browser profiles are stored under ignored `.ralph/`. Never commit real user recordings or credentials. Existing files in `docs/verification/` are dated evidence; older companion results do not verify current Chrome behavior.
